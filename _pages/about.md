<p>Hi there, I'm Marianne! It took me about 5 years to graduate college, but I graduated debt free, all while having studied abroad 4 times, and traveled to 21 different countries (just in college!) Read more about how I embraced my time in school and my advice for thriving during the best years of your life! / I'm writing this to help you stay out of debt and have the best four, five, six years of your life!</p>

<p>I also happen to really love food, startups and travel and I'll be talking about those as well. </p>

<p>I’m Marianne – a first year college student exploring new things to discover my passions and live a more fulfilling and meaningful life! I’ve always believed in the importance of trying new things and learning from each experience. I hope to encourage you all to try new things and join me on my journey to do the same!
