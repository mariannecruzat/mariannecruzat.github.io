You all should listen to me when I say that you should start packing early, especially if you’re taking multiple airlines with different baggage restrictions! If you’re anything like me, you will probably have overweight luggage after you first “finish” packing and measure your luggage for the first time. I like to be well prepared for any situation (the rain, the heat and even occasional business casual events that might take place), which means extra outfits, extra equipment and ultimately extra weight in my check-in bag.

I started packing the 2 days before our departure, which was May 16th and finished at 4am on May 16th. Needless to say, I ended up getting 3 hours of sleep before having to get ready and drive to the airport. This wasn’t too bad since I knew I was going to be getting some sleep on the 12-hour flight from Frankfurt, Germany to Changhi, Singapore (I didn’t get as much sleep as I thought I would as I actually wrote this post and spent a few hours editing 1000 photos and watched “The 5th Wave” on this flight.) I should have started packing earlier to save myself stress, time and money, but I tend to have good procrastinating abilities.

As I’m writing this blog post, my group and I are actually 6 hours away from Singapore and are currently flying over Maymaneh, Afghanistan. It’s been a long, but great journey so far! My study abroad group and I didn’t really have much time to get to know each other before we moved out of our residence halls so it was great learning more about everyone over card games and during random walks around the airport and the long flights.

At JFK, I was able to try a burger from the Shake Shack for the first time and I’m not sure the burger was actually delicious or if I was just starving but I enjoyed my first time at Shack Burger. After lunch, a few friends and I went to exchange USD to Singaporean dollars and after having no luck at the first counter we went to (they didn’t carry Singapore currency) we waited 30 minutes for the worker to return to the other counter we were referred to. As we excitedly approached the counter to exchange our money, we walked away with USD still in our hands because he only had Singaporean $5 to exchange. Needing a couple hundred dollars to exchange, we decided it might be wiser to exchange money in Singapore. Not soon after, we all boarded Singapore Airlines to begin our international journey. My friend, Kristen, went on the same trip 2 summers ago and spoke about the food on the flight with such fervor so I excited to eat this supposedly delicious “airplane food”. Fortunately, she didn’t over exaggerate and the food was actually good and they served us plenty of it! (I have to give my shout out to the Mango-Raspberry ice cream we were given. I was in heaven for the 5 minutes I was eating it.)

Truth be told, due to the stressful time I had while packing my stuff, it didn’t sink in that I was going to be traveling around Southeast Asia for 10 weeks! 6 hours away from Singapore, I’m beginning to realize that this is actually happening! To those who don’t know, I will be spending a month in Singapore, 2 weeks in Vietnam, 2 weeks in Thailand, 11 days in the Philippines, then I will stay a few days in Thailand before I return back to America. I am super excited as I have never been to Singapore, Vietnam, or Thailand nor have I traveled in the Philippines without my parents and siblings! I am super excited for the places we’ll visit, the people we’ll meet, the food we’ll eat and the overall exciting journey that is ahead! With that, I end this long blog post and invite you to follow me on my journey throughout SE Asia! I promise the other posts won’t be as long 😉 !

Love Always,

Marianne
