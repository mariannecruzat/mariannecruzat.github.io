# It's Not Too Late to Find a Virtual Internship for the Summer

Speaking from personal experiences, it's not too late to find a virtual internship for the summer! I'm speaking on behalf of the startup I'm working for - we're still hiring for the summer and we are planning doing it on a rolling basis throughout the summer. As long as we find the right talent, we're willing to take on interns!

As a company, we're aware that there are many qualified students who are still looking for internships and within a startup, there's always a lot of work to be done. COVID-19 may have ruined many traditional internship plans at a large corporation, however, that doesn't mean all internships have disappeared. Smaller companies such as startups are able to be more flexible and pivot their work model - working remotely instead of coming into a physical office space.

That said, your competition for these internships is likely higher than normal as the opportunities are likely limited so you must do your best to stand out and ace the application process. As a recruiter, I've seen some crazy good and downright terrible applications. I've also been on the other side of the table as an applicant to various positions. To help you in your application process, I've thought through some tips to help you stand out and find a virtual internship.

## Tips to Help You Find a Summer Virtual Internship

### Initial Application

In this section, I'm assuming that you're just beginning your application process to a company.

<ol>

**<li> Cover your bases </li>**


By this, I mean make sure that your resume is good, your cover letter is thoughtful and unique and your emails are free of typos. These are basics when it comes to finding an internship/job. When done right, it doesn't give you bonus points, but if you do it wrong or sloppily, that can cost you the interview. This means that a good resume is a basic necessity when applying to any position. Without a good resume, there's a good chance you may get passed up - not because you don't qualify, but because your resume was unorganized and hard to read. If you want a good resume template, shoot me an email with the Subject "Resume Template Please" and I'll send you what I've used to help me land seven jobs and internships while in college.

**<li> Reach out to recruiters/employees of the company on LinkedIn </li>**

This is an underrated but super important tip when it comes to getting super competitive internships. Reach out to the recruiter or current employees of the company and ask them for a quick 15 minute informal interview. Tell them you're interested in learning more about the company because you're interested in applying. Many people are very willing to help - give them a compelling reason why!

Pro Tip: Check LinkedIn to see if there are any alumni from your school who work at that company. A warm lead like this can make it easier to get into the company rather than just messaging someone cold.

**<li> Follow up diligently </li>**

If you don't hear anything the first time, follow up! Many times, people just forget to respond or your email got buried in their mailbox - I've definitely had this happen many times to my mailbox this summer. That said, I was especially impressed when I saw someone followed up. If their resume wasn't the most impressive, but their actions showed that they were eager to work with us and were consistent in following up, I considered them for the first round.

**<li>Use your connections!!</li>**

Like I mentioned in the tip above from #2, use your connections to help you land a job! Check LinkedIn to see if any of your connections or alumni are hiring! Ask around in your network to see if anyone is hiring. Make a compelling post on your LinkedIn profile that you are looking for an internship. You've got to put yourself out there in order to find something! Don't be afraid to do it!

</ol>

### Interview Phase

In this part, I have assumed that you passed the first round, which is a resume dump / application and have been invited for an interview.

<ol>

**<li>Be prepared - Read about the company and understand what they do!</li>**

Oh man, if I was given $5 every time an applicant I spoke with didn't understand what we did as a company, I'd have a decent amount of savings. This is an instant red flag as a recruiter (at least for smaller companies). If you're applying for a large company like Google which has multiple products and functions, I would hope that you understand what that division does or what the product is. That said, please do not be one of these applicants! It's a stupid way to lose the opportunity.

**<li>Be early, test your technology and have it ready!</li>**

This is especially important during these times! With everyone having to use video conferencing for school, you should be very familiar with this technology. There are many things that could go wrong as you're pulling up the Zoom or Google Meet links so give yourself a few minutes in case your computer is being slow or the link isn't working properly.

**<li>Have questions and ask good questions</li>**

There's nothing more impressive than a candidate who asks good questions. When a candidate asks good questions, that signals to me that they are thoughtful, analytical, did their research, and are genuinely interested in the company. I have a theory that I have also gotten many of my internships because the questions I asked were thoughtful. Of course, this doesn't replace being prepared for the interview, but it helps set you apart as a candidate when you ask good questions.

**<li>Send a thank you email afterwards!</li>**

After the interview, please remember to send your interviewers a thank you email! A thank you goes a long way in helping the recruiter remember you - which can be crucial if they're interviewing 10s or 100s of people. It's also just a really nice gesture, so please do it!

</ol>
