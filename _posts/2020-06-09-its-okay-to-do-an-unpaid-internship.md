# Should I Do An Unpaid Internship? Why It's Okay To Do An Unpaid Internship.

While in college, I had three unpaid internships and three paid internships - I'm just as grateful to have had my unpaid internship experiences as my paid internship experiences.

**Here's why it's okay to do an unpaid internship - for the experience you'll get. Unpaid internships often give the greatest exposure within the business and teaches interns a lot about being scrappy and hardworking, regardless of compensation.**

I'm not saying that you should just always accept an unpaid internship position, try to negotiate a stipend if you're able to! However, if you're unable to secure a paid internship (because situations like COVID-19 made things difficult or you don't have experience), don't feel too down on yourself! Doing an unpaid internship will allow you to build your resume, gain experience and industry knowledge!

I'll be honest with you, there were some times during my life that I became envious of my banking or consulting friends (I was a business major in college) who all had relatively high paying internships while I was doing an unpaid internship. However, I can pretty confidently say that I learned more doing unpaid internships with small, scrappy startups who couldn't afford to pay me than my friends did at their fancy paid internships.

Why is that? Well that's because I was able to work closely with the founders/leaders. This means that I was in the same room as they were discussing important business decisions and were planning strategy for their company. Eventually, I became a source of feedback / brain to bounce ideas off of. This in turn helped me to better organize my thoughts and formulate a better idea of what kinds of things a business leader needs to do in order to have a successful business.

I can't say that everyone who's had an unpaid internship has had the same experience as me though. Nor does everyone have the same intention as me when it comes to what they want to get out of an internship.

For me, I've always wanted to build a business, therefore, I always chose the internship opportunity that I thought would best help me understand how to build a successful business.

If that's not you, then evaluate why you want an internship in the first place. Are you doing it for the...

 - Money
 - Experience
 - Resume Booster
 - Bragging Rights
 - Networking Opportunities
 - Full-Time Job Offer
 - Opportunity to Enter a New Industry / Role
 - Other

Once you understand the reason why you want an internship, it's much easier to figure out if doing an unpaid internship makes sense for you.

If you're doing it for the money, then you're in the wrong place. This article isn't for you.

If you're doing it for any of the other reasons listed on that list, then maybe it's okay to look into unpaid internships. Who knows, maybe after working for them for a bit, you can negotiate getting paid something - that happened to me before and it felt pretty great when they agreed to it.

If you want to hear about that story / how I negotiated that, let me know and I may just write about it!

I'm happy to try and be helpful.
