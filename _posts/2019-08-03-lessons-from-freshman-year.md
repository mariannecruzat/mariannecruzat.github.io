What better time to reflect on your college experience than when you‚Äôre studying for your last final as a first year student? Coming into college, I had no idea what to expect. My first year did not turn out like I thought it would; it turned out even better than I expected! Sure there were bumps along the way, but my journey through my first year was definitely one for the books. As I reflected, there were many lessons that I learned along the way and advice I would like to share to college-bound folks! Here they are below, in no particular order:

## 1. College is a time for growth.

No matter how long you want to stay a ‚Äúkid‚Äù, being in the college environment will challenge you and force you to grow. You may as well embrace it while you can. The person who I was the day I moved in is not the same as the person who moved out on May 6th. The people I met consistently challenged my beliefs. They made me question why I believed what I believed and why I did what I did. I came out more confident because of this. Once I knew what I stood for, I was confident in my actions and my words.

## 2. College is not like high school.

In high school, I was considered a top student. Looking back, everything I went through in high school seemed so easy compared to what I‚Äôm going through now. My first year of college, I struggled to understand why I didn‚Äôt do as well and it was because I treated everything as if I was still in high school. I will tell you now, college is not the same at all. Classes are harder. Programs and students are more competitive. There are more distractions. Managing your time will be harder. You will have more responsibilities. You will have more expenses. At the same time, college is more fun. Classes are more enlightening. You have more freedom. It‚Äôs all about balancing everything and realizing that although there are more challenges, there are also more rewards in the end.

## 3. Building a professional network is so important.

My first year, there were a few personal projects that I began to work on. In order to get answers to my questions and meet people who could help me complete my projects, I had to rely on my network to introduce me to such people. Although I could have ‚Äúcold-called‚Äù them, they were more receptive of what I had to say after a warm introduction. At first, I wasn‚Äôt sure exactly of how I should go about meeting people, but then I just decided that any person I meet has the potential to change my life in the future. After realizing this, I started out by getting to know my peers and my professors really well. Afterward, I started going to events and club meetings of topics that I was interested in. Just by doing these little things, I was able to get a hold of many opportunities that I wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise had if it wasn‚Äôt for my network.

## 4. Having a roommate can be challenging.

I had the perfect roommate for my first year. She was so sweet, thoughtful and encouraging. When things were getting tough in school, she would provide encouraging words to help get me through the week. We shared the room equally. Our food was gathered in the same place. Our furniture was free for everyone to use. We shared the refrigerator and microwave. We were able to work around our different sleeping habits. We even started a workout regime together. We honestly had such a great roommate relationship. Despite our great relationship, it was tough sometimes because together we had way too much stuff and our tiny dorm room did not help. During those rare occasions that I really just wanted to be by myself after a long day, having a roommate made that a little difficult. Coming into college, I was used to having my own room, so it was definitely an adjustment for me sharing a space with someone.

## 5. I had to learn how to study efficiently.

In high school, last minute cramming surprisingly worked every time. Okay, most of the time. In college, after I took my first test, I realized that cramming was not going to cut it this time. Not only is the material harder to understand, but I had to manage my time more wisely during my first year. Some of my previous study habits did not work either. I had to try different things from flash cards to study guides to try and figure out what best worked for me. I still haven‚Äôt mastered it, but I‚Äôm better off now than I was earlier. Progress üôÇ

## 6. My peers are really cool.

Going into college, I didn‚Äôt realize that I would meet such cool and inspiring people. I‚Äôve met so many students who have started so many cool programs, businesses, and non-profits, traveled around the world, could speak 3+ languages, were Junior Olympians, etc‚Ä¶ They all seemed like they had their life together and were super passionate about what they did. Going into college, I didn‚Äôt realize that I would find myself doubting my abilities, but being around them made me feel just that. I felt like this until I figured out what I was truly passionate about: entrepreneurship. Finding this and being able to fully pursue it, it didn‚Äôt matter to me what my peers did because they didn‚Äôt accomplish what I wanted to do. I was able to truly finish my first year more confident and used my peers as inspiration to truly find what I was passionate about.
