It’s been approximately 8 days and 13 hours since we landed in Changi airport. It’s quite hard to believe. Maybe I’m exaggerating a little bit, but it seems as if I’ve lived here for many years, quickly becoming well acquainted with public transportation and how to correctly order Kopi. These past few days have been exciting, packed with sweaty excursion after another, opportunities to try food with names I can’t pronounce and to make long lasting memories.

Starting off with Wednesday, upon arrival at Changi airport, we were greeted by our fantastic SEAS NUS coordinators, Navin and Phyllis. From there, we took a tour of U-Town and I was able to get my first taste of food in Singapore. Bah Mian was the name of the hot noodle dish I ordered. It had thin noodles with green veggies (still unsure what veggie) and anchovies. To accompany my delicious noodles, I accidently ordered Horlicks, dinosaur style. According to Navin, Horlicks is similar to Ovaltine and dinosaur meant they put an extra scoop of the powder mix on top to add texture and extra flavor. It’s quite interesting how Singaporeans have a whole code system to order their drinks just the way they like it, “o” meaning using sugar to sweet drinks instead of the typical condensed milk, “c/si” meaning using evaporated milk, and “kosong” meaning not sweetened by sugar or condensed milk.

That was just the beginning of my food adventures/exploration in Singapore. Never would I have thought that I would get a taste of frog, but it seems that I’ve become a bit more adventurous while abroad. I’ve also come to realize that I am not as knowledgeable about Asian food as I thought I was. The Chinese cuisine in Singapore is 10 levels above the Chinese takeout that I get back in the US. It’s quite overwhelming, actually, how many different options there are and to make my decision even harder when it comes to ordering food, Malay and Indian food are also very common. To my surprise, I have found that I would probably rank Indian cuisine pretty low on my favorite cuisine list. I thought I liked curry and that all curry was the same, but I was proven wrong. There is a difference between Indian curry and Thai curry. On the bright side, I further confirmed that Mango Lassi is undeniably one of the best drinks ever created.

Through the lectures from Dr. Quek and Professor Yue and our guided excursions throughout the city, my eyes were opened to many of the great things about Singapore as well as its many areas of improvement. There is no doubt in my mind that Singapore is a very efficient country. After leaving the Singapore City Gallery, I was left in awe thinking about how far Singapore has come in the past few decades and it’s plans for improvement in the future. As I think of all of this improvement, I think of my experience in Little India and the room for progress when it comes to equality amongst race and socioeconomics. As Navin said though, “baby steps,” I suppose.

Needless to say, from day 1 I fell in love with Singapore, though I could do away with the heat waves. Time has gone by unbelievably quick, with only 17 days remaining until we depart for Vietnam and I’m not sure how I feel about it. In just the 8 days here, I have quite enjoyed myself and could realistically see Singapore as place of residence in my future. Until next week!

Pro tip: Stay hydrated! The 2nd day, I felt terrible by the end of the night the combined effects of dehydration and exhaustion.
